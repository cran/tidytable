# tidytable 0.5.7

#### Deprecations
* The `dt_verb()` versions of functions have been removed from the package.
They have been deprecated with warnings since v0.5.2

#### Functionality improvements
* `crossing.()`: Now works with data frame inputs (@moutikabdessabour, #143)
* `distinct.()`: Can rename columns (#153)
* `get_dummies.()`: Dummy columns are now sorted in alphabetical order
* `pivot_wider.()`: Added `values_fill` argument

#### Functions with notable speed improvements
* `get_dummies.()`
* `fill.()`
* `slice.()`

#### Bug fixes
* `mutate.()`: Can delete a column using `NULL` when `.by` is provided (#151)
* `mutate_across.()`: Can reference other columns in .fns call (#145)
* `slice.()`: Works when `.by` contains all columns (#158)
* `unnest.()`: Works when the only column is the list column (#144)

# tidytable 0.5.6

#### Breaking changes
* `bind_cols.()`: Name repair uses `vec_as_names()` instead of `vec_as_names_legacy()`

#### Functionality improvements
* `bind_cols.()`: Added `.name_repair` arg
* `unnest.()`: Added `names_sep` and `names_repair` args
* `print()`
  + Added `n`, `width`, and `n_extra` args
  + Now prints like tibbles in all cases (special thanks to @moutikabdessabour)
* `slice.()`: Can now drop specified rows with negative numbers

#### New functions
* `arrange_across.()`
* `case_when.()`
  + The old "case when" translation `case.()` will remain in the package,
  as it is called like `data.table::fcase()` but allows for the `default`
  to be a vector.
* `desc.()`

#### Functions with notable speed improvements
* `slice.()`
  
#### Deprecations
* `unnest.()`: `.keep_all` arg changed to `.drop`

# tidytable 0.5.5

#### Breaking changes
* `bind_rows.()`: Removed `.use_names` and `.fill` args
  + These are now assumed to be `TRUE`, which matches `dplyr` semantics.
* `complete.()`: `.fill` arg renamed to `fill`
* `pull.()`: defaults to `var = -1` instead of `var = NULL`
  + The result is the same when using the default value,
  but will break cases where `var = NULL` was explicitly called.
* `slice.()`: `.by` must be named when slicing by group

#### Functionality improvements
* `tidytable` now integrates better with tidyverse functions through `vctrs`. This means code such as
`vec_cbind(tibble::tibble(x = 1:3), tidytable(y = "foo"))`
will bind the results into a tidytable.
* `complete.()`: Can now append extra values
* `pull.()`: Numerical selection now works
* `slice.()`: Now uses `...` to select which rows to slice

#### New functions
* `semi_join.()`

#### Bug fixes
* `rename.()`: Works when there are spaces in the column names (#109)

#### Functions with notable speed improvements
* `replace_na.()`

# tidytable 0.5.4

#### Breaking changes
* Column names auto-generated by `summarize_across.()` now use a suffix
instead of a prefix

#### Functionality improvements
* `mutate_across.()`: Added `.names` arg to help with naming newly created columns
* `summarize_across.()`: Added `.names` arg to help with naming newly created columns
* `summarize.()`: Added `.sort` arg to optionally sort the resulting data.table

#### Bug fixes
* `transmute.()`: Doesn't drop "by" columns (#98)
* `slice.()`
  + Allows gaps in `rows` arg (#99)
  + Doesn't reorder columns when using `.by` (#101)
* `full_join.()`: No longer returns a keyed data.table (#102)

#### Internal
* Import `tibble`
  + Enables cleaner console printing of tidytables
  + `glimpse()` is now reexported
  + Will be replaced by `pillar` in a later release once `tibble::trunc_mat()` &
  `tibble::glimpse()` are moved there

# tidytable 0.5.2

* This version contains general performance improvements

#### Deprecations
* Group by arg `by` has been deprecated for `.by`.
This will allow "by" to be used as a column name in `mutate.()` & `summarize.()` in future releases.
* All `dt_verb()` functions are soft deprecated


#### New functions

* `distinct.()`
* `drop_na.()`
* `relocate.()`

#### Bug fixes

# tidytable 0.3.2

#### tidytable class
* New `tidytable` class is a data.table subclass with cleaner printing.
* Operates like a data.table in all other cases.

#### New functions
* tidytable constructors:
  + `tidytable()`: Create a data.table/tidytable
  + `as_tidytable()`: Convert to data.table/tidytable

* Updated `dt()` docs per CRAN instructions
